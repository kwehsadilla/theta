# intro

theta is an assessment tool to calculate your co2 fingerprint. it's an ecological webapp in that it asks you some questions, and based on that gives you a score at the end.

# deps

jquery

# assessment

since this app is still in the beta stage, there are only three questions so far, just to demo what it can do. more questions, and a much more precise assessment are in the works. there is certainly room for that in the code, and the app scales well with growth.

## scoring

these are some examples of what theta asks to factor in for the assessment process.

### energy

based on the user's energy supplier and how sustaible the energy sources are.

### water

based on the abundance in the water source(s) and how efficiently water is used.

### material

surveys the user for dates of construction, types, and durabilty of the user's materials.

### other factors

more points of assessment are in the works. stay tuned.
